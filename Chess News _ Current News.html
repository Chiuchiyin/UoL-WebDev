                        <p>Magnus Carlsen won a historic 136-move game in Game 6 of the World Chess Championship, which
                            was
                            the longest game in world champsionhip history. This appeared to be a turning point in the
                            event, and foreshadows the retainment of his title as reigning world champion. A popular
                            prediction is a 7.5-3.5 final result in favour of Carlsen.</p>

                <p>GM Ian Nepomniachtchi began game eight in the 2021 FIDE World Championship with a beautifully
                    crafted
                    defense against a Petroff opening. He faltered in the end game stage of the match after
                    blundering a
                    pawn and having his position collapse thereafter. Carlsen extends his lead 5-3 over his
                    challenger,
                    and seems to bring to fruition the prediction of GM Hans Niemann, who stated "I think if Nepo
                    loses
                    one game, the match is over, just from him, as a player."</p>

                        in the 1960 Leipzig Olympiad. His first breakthrough occurred at the age of 13, in which he
                        became the British U18 Champion and continued on to win the championship of London.</p>

                        another

                        in Game 4. Contrary to Nepomniatchi's typical opening repertoire, which consists of the
                        Grunfeld
                        or
                        the tactically sharp Najdorf, he opted for a less popular opening —
                        the Petroff. Is the challenger taking inspiration from Caruana - who played this opening
                        against
                        Carlsen a few years ago?</p>

                    <p>The Tata Steel Chess India event has its origins in Kolkata. In the event, four foreign
                        players
                        will
                        be pitted against six Indian players. In the first rounds, Aronian acquired a 1-point lead
                        over
                        Praggnanandhaa and Erigaisi. Back in 2018, the winner of the event was Hikaru Nakamura.
                        Viswanathan
                        Anand also managed to represent his country with a formidable top finish in the blitz

                        the

                    <p>In terms of genius, Carlsen speculates that many people would say Fischer. Carlsen believes
                        Capablanca outclassed Fischer in that respect. In terms of entertainment value, Carlsen
                        believes
                        Tal
                        is the best by far. In terms of influence, he believes Kasporov deserves the title as an
                        influential
                        modern player. And finally in terms of sanity, Carlsen believes Anand is the most
                        level-headed opponent he has played.</p>
