    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of this website is to provide coverage of trending chess events and tournaments in an engaging fashion.
        The target demographic ranges from chess enthusiasts to novice players and experienced
        players alike.
        It caters to novice players by providing statistics (in the 'About Us' page) regarding the popularity and
        international appeal of chess as a means of
        bandwagon. It also caters to more experienced players by referencing advanced chess openings (i.e. mentioning of
        opening repertoire such as the Petroff opening in the 'Current News' page) and international
        tournament results at the highest level of play. The website aims to inspire the masses to pick up the sport,
        and
        to educate and inform chess enthusiasts on recent developments in the chess world.
    </p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>The ‘Home’ and ‘Current News’ pages employ compact grid layouts to present dense information in the form of a
        newspaper. The layouts are uniform yet not identical; these pages have a similar overall structure to visually
        group articles and increase cohesion, but have distinct layouts which engage the reader to probe each section
        further.<br><br>
        The 'Home' page has a carousel that compacts many CTAs into a small space, thereby reducing vertical scrolling
        and maintaining accessibility. The 'Current News' page uses a sidebar as an aside to put tangential information
        and removes clutter from the main content. The ‘Top Players’ page is comfortable yet dynamic, as the negative
        space considerations around the player column cards and animated timeline contrast the dense, compact layouts of
        the grid layout pages. As a result, the content is rendered scannable and yields improvements in legibility and
        comprehension.<br><br>
        A unified structure exists between the column cards, which are separated into distinct sections by a decorative
        element. This decorative element serves as a section divider throughout the web site, creating a thematic
        feature that creates a stable theme. The page structure for the ‘Contact Us’ and ‘About Us’ pages mirror the
        comfortable feel of the ‘Top
        Players’ page, which was intended to provide the reader with relief following the information overload of the
        grid layouts presented in the ‘Home’ and ‘Current News’ pages.<br><br>
        The comfortable layouts contain less textual information and rely on visual imagery to convey a less dense yet
        appealing message. For instance, the ‘Contact Us’ page uses hypermedia (including social media icons and
        Scalable Vector Graphics) and interactivity (an embedded Google Maps and a contact form) to transmit its
        message, as well as a main banner that occupies the majority of the viewport and primes the user for a more
        visually-driven layout. Similarly, the uniquely identifying structure of the ‘About Us’ page is a Gutenberg
        Diagram-inspired layout, which prepares the user for the primarily visual grid layout containing icons and
        statistics. The grid layout creates a visually striking impression by contrasting white and dark themed chess
        background.
    </p>

    <h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

    <h3>FIDE World Chess Championship 2021</h3>
    <p>The recent FIDE World Chess Championship was a fourteen-game match between the reigning champion, Magnus Carlsen,
        and formidable challenger, Ian Nepomnichtchi. The matches generally take place under classical time controls,
        which result in slower, more analytical chess games. Despite the relaxed nature of the games, I often found
        myself waking up early to witness the matches and accompanying commentary. Guided by the Stockfish engine, the
        detailed analysis conducted by higher-level players revealed the hidden dynamics of each position and ultimately
        provided more insight into the game.<br><br>
        As an avid chess player myself, designing this chess-themed website inspired me to search for more opportunities
        to play the game. Having realized that this event must have captured the intrigue of many novice players, I
        could only imagine the extent to which the commentators’ input would benefit a seasoned player. I thus aspired
        to mirror this experience in an inclusive and user-friendly interface that highlighted key chess events on an
        international scale and catered to players of all backgrounds and levels. In addition, the immense success of
        the Netflix series, 'The Queen's Gambit' – the platform’s most watched show in sixty-three countries – resulted
        in a substantial increase in the number of novice chess players, thereby indicating a large consumer base with
        high demand.
    </p>
    <h3>Chess.com's Responsive Design</h3>
    <p>Over the course of this project, I have since become much more observant and sensitive to website designs that I
        encounter. For instance, I experimented with the screen dimensions to estimate the
        media queries used. I also carefully inspected the fluidity of layout arrangements, as flexible images and text
        were
        sized in relative units (i.e. ems in relatin to the parent element or rem in relation to the root element) in
        order to adapt to different screen dimensions, reinforce design fidelity, and maximize
        accessibility. Avoiding fixed size units (i.e. px) has the added benefit of supporting browser zoom and font
        size
        adjustments based on a user's changes to the default browser font size.<br><br>
        I initially struggled to adapt the sidebar for smaller screen sizes on the ‘Current News’ page. However, I soon
        realized that relocating the sidebar would reduce clutter and enhance the user interface. Otherwise, elements
        could be rendered invisible on tablet and mobile devices, as may be seen with the carousel on the ‘Home’ page,
        the timeline images in the ‘Top Players’ page, and the image text overlay on the ‘Home’ and ‘Current News’
        pages. In this way, a custom-tailored user experience was created for different devices by eliminating
        horizontal scrolling, ensuring the visibility of CTAs, scaling the font for readability, and eliminating
        bandwidth-intensive elements that would increase load times. After some trial and error, I ultimately decided to
        streamline the layout
        arrangement process by adopting a mobile-first approach. This enabled me to identify the critical content in the
        hierarchy of information and incrementally support large-screen devices from a simple initial framework.
    </p>
    <h3>WCAG Accessibility Standards</h3>
    <p>Throughout this project, the interface was designed with WCAG accessibility standards in mind and a focus on
        luminance contrast ratios, in order to render the site more widely accessible to both general users and those
        with disabilities. The implementation of a contrast toggling button thus took colour contrast compliance into
        account, with a low contrast mode that caters to dyslexic individuals. In light of the consequences associated
        with excessive animation on users with vestibular disorders, I decided to reserve animated content for essential
        purposes, such as demarcating important interactive elements and ensuring smoother transitions for elements
        floating into the viewport. As such, I employed animations that were nuanced with ease-in and ease-out
        considerations at appropriate, nuanced intervals.<br><br>
        Moreover, the website headers were strategically sized and nested according to relative importance in order to
        guide assistive technologies, maintain a logical flow of information, and ultimately present a clear visual
        hierarchy. For instance, the use of “Aria-label” allows various elements to be catalogued by screen readers,
        which facilitates navigation, provides a clear frame of reference for user interface controls, and enhances the
        identification and classification of key parts of code. As a result, the visual hierarchy ensures a
        highly-organized information architecture through a consistent layout and the appropriate use of semantic
        elements.
    </p>

    <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

    <h3>Accessibility dropdown menu which offers font legibility, link underlining, and grayscale mode</h3>
    <p>
        The accessibility dropdown menu is indicated by a univerisally recognized wheelchair symbol, which immediately
        establishes its purpose. The first accessibility option uses an objectively legible font, Arial, in place of all
        font families on the
        web page. Designed specifically to enhance online readability, sans-serif fonts are considered more legible than
        decorative, narrow, and serif fonts. The second accessibility option underlines links on the page to emphasize
        their importance and demarcate the links as CTAs. Underlining is traditionally used to indicate a link, which
        not only ensures that users will not misinterpret its meaning or intent, but also distinguishes between
        interactive and purely visual elements. The third accessibility option offers a grayscale mode, which removes
        bright and distracting saturated colours for general users and improves readability for colour-blind users. This
        further reduces eye strain under low light conditions, especially for dense blocks of text. Each
        accessibility option is accompanied by a corresponding high-contrast tooltip that clearly indicates the
        accessibility feature. This user-triggered GUI element becomes visible when a mouse-hover gesture is detected
        and provides a brief, temporary description that avoids collisions with critical main content elements.
    </p>
    <h3>Contrast toggle button for legibility and back-to-top button to reduce vertical scrolling</h3>

    <p>The default colour scheme is the high luminance contrast mode, which is ideal to reduce eye strain for users with
        visual impairments, such as older users with degraded colour contrast sensitivity. On the contrary, a low
        luminance contrast ratio, such as gray text on a dark-gray background, impairs legibility and reduces the
        content’s findability and perceived importance. Low contrast text is similar to fine print in the sense that it
        gives the impression of an attempt to obscure information or deceive the user. A user experiencing difficulty
        locating content would diminish the overall user experience, especially on smaller screens or under the glare of
        the sun.<br><br>
        Gray or dimmed features are also conventionally associated with disabled options and thus result in
        misinterpretation of meaning. Those with cognitive impairment such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
        (ADHD) may benefit from high luminance contrast due to their limited attention span, as obscured text may
        further impair their concentration abilities.<br><br>
        Toggled by the button embedded in the navigation bar, the low luminance contrast mode enables dyslexic
        individuals to read more efficiently, due to reduced variation in hues, saturation, and brightness.
        However, achieving this outcome does not come at the expense of functionality, visual aesthetics, and
        uniformity. This was due to a curated color palette.
    </p>

    <h3>Nuanced animations to account for users with photosensitive epilepsy or those
        susceptible
        to
        seizures</h3>
    <p>In consideration of users with photosensitive epilepsy or those susceptible to seizures, hypermedia was kept to a
        minimum and animations with flashing content and repetitive rates or patterns were used sparingly. The main
        animated effects that were used consisted of fade-in and slide-in effects, along with a smooth scroll-to-top
        effect. Subtle grow-and-shrink animations for the double left caret symbols indicate a text overlay on important
        images as well. The smooth nature of the fade-in and slide-in animations that occur once does not detract from
        the main content of the page, thereby satisfying the ‘Three Flashes or Below Threshold’. The use of embedded
        videos was also avoided as they may slow down the browser’s rendering and reduce perceived responsiveness, and
        may contain
        flashing or blinking content. In addition, excessive movement or repetition prevents screen readers from
        capturing the movement or registering the content accurately. </p>

    <h2 id="usability">Usability</h2>

    <h3>Using the Gutenberg Diagram on reading gravity to model the layout of critical information</h3>
    <p>The layout of the ‘About Us’ page was modelled with the Gutenberg Diagram in mind, which describes a user’s
        reading gravity (a Z-pattern) and consists of four quadrants – the primary optical area, strong fallow area,
        weak follow area, and terminal area.<br><br>
        Critical information is presented in the primary optical area, which is the user’s default primary focus and
        smooths user navigation by limiting lateral movement. The headers and subheaders are strategically positioned in
        this quadrant to emphasize their significance, as may be seen in the ‘Small Beginnings’ and ‘Our Vision’
        sections on the 'About Us' page. The strong fallow area and weak fallow area – the blind spot – are much less
        regarded, as the supporting images on the 'About Us' page are secondary to the main content and are displayed in
        these regions.<br><br>
        The terminal area typically causes a pause in the user’s page scan area, which signifies the end of a major
        section and facilitates the transition into a new section. On the ‘About Us’ page, the terminal area finishes
        with another block of information that segues either into a section divider (in the case of the first Gutenberg
        Diagram), or into a completely unique, visually-driven grid layout (as seen with the second Gutenberg Diagram).

    <h3>Using Fitt’s Law to improve call to action accessibility by limiting pointer movement and increasing the
        size of
        clickable
        fields</h3>
    <p>According to Fitt’s Law, the ‘time required to move to a target area is a function between the distance to the
        target and the size of the target’ [36]. Fitt’s Law was integrated into the website by increasing the padding of
        call to action buttons and reducing pointer movement by making related buttons or links proximal to one another.
        As a result, precise gestures are not required by the user and the buttons remain accessible even on smaller
        screen sizes or touch screens, which require more finger dexterity.<br><br>
        To further limit pointer movement, a sticky navigation bar was implemented to render navigation accessible at
        any point along the vertical scroll bar. As the sticky navigation bar initially limited the viewport, the page
        title was rendered invisible to correct this error. The inverse of Fitt’s Law was also applied to less
        pertinent, tangential sidebar information, as the target clicking space was reduced to prevent accidental
        activation.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Introducing a responsive layout and a toggleable hamburger menu to accommodate smaller screen sizes</h3>
    <p>Given that the majority of traffic now stems from mobile users, responsive behaviour is critical in smaller
        screen sizes. A key element in mobile or tablet devices is the introduction of a hamburger menu, which
        strategically organizes links into a single column and improves overall clickability. The hamburger menu
        provides clean, compact navigation that increases the main content viewport region on small-sized screens.
        Without responsive
        design, the columns would collide or show fewer words per line, thus impairing readability (i.e. by vertically
        stacking words).<br><br>
        On the website, the sidebars were either moved into a single column to mirror the single column flow of
        information primed by the toggleable navigation menu, or removed altogether to minimize clutter. Ems and rems
        were
        purposefully selected for the font size in order to inherit from parent elements or
        browser font settings, as pixels are a fixed
        sized unit that do not adapt to changes in screen dimensions – a problem that is exacerbated by the presence of
        modern
        widescreen displays and TVs in addition to mobile devices.<br><br>
        In general, the website was designed to accommodate smaller screen sizes by maintaining layout flexibility,
        ensuring a clear interface, and creating a focal point by centralizing key blocks of text.
    </p>

    <h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

    <h3>Learning how to preserve user settings on a page after ending a browser session</h3>
    <p>According to the Web API section of the MDN web docs, sessionStorage is cleared when the session ends, while
        localStorage remains accessible since it has no expiration date – with the exception of private browsing. In
        order to store the user’s settings, a key value pair indicating the current status of the Storage object was
        stored and its status on page load was monitored to restore its settings. This was implemented in the ‘Toggle
        Contrast’ button embedded in the navigation menu, in which either the high or low contrast user preferences were
        recorded.<br><br>
        Since the Storage object is stored purely on the client, it reduces content requests from the web server, which
        corresponds with faster load times and increased responsiveness. However, there is little control over locally
        stored data due to a lack of database. With localStorage, developers may potentially lose all information after
        a user clears their cache and has no method of updating the information after storage.
    </p>

    <h3>Determining the use cases of CSS flexbox and CSS grid in relation to their complexity and layout advantages
    </h3>
    <p>Through trial and error, I discovered that flex-wrap was not in fact a viable solution to explicit responsive
        design. The wrapping of content was often not visually sound depending on the context and relationship between
        the content sections. Flex-wrap was effective when the content was uniform and did not require certain content
        to be adjacent to other related content.
        In cases in which proportionality was irrelevant, having five equal columns wrapping into three smaller columns
        and two larger columns was acceptable.<br><br>Visualization of the layout was intuitive with the use of CSS
        grid,
        since
        fractional units could not only be used for both the row tracks and column tracks, but also specify the exact
        dimensions of a particular element.
        With flexbox, I realized that one-dimensional layouts provided much more flexibility due to the complete control
        on alignment (i.e. vertically centering an element) and the expansion of the flexbox element to occupy space via
        flex-grow. Flexbox had many complex relationships between the containers and the flex properties of its child
        elements, but was not limited by the left and right positioning limitations of float and the reduced alignment
        and space distribution control of CSS grid. However, I preferred the grid layout for two-dimensional layouts
        that required strict control for row and column properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Using the jQuery library in order to enable the accessibility button to be toggled and apply the
        corresponding
        accessibility options</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout this project, I recognized the value in using the lightweight jQuery library as a means of
        simplifying the DOM
        tree traversal and manipulating the elements within it. Since jQuery is open source, there were a myriad of
        tutorials to guide me through the challenging syntax. Moreover, jQuery seamlessly integrated with the Visual
        Studio IDE through the Manage NuGET Packages
        dialog box which streamlined access to jQuery functions within the IDE. Learning jQuery facilitated the creation
        of event handlers
        and made toggling CSS classes much easier than with standard vanilla JavaScript.<br><br>
        However, one major simplification I noticed was that the syntax required the document to fully load before the
        JavaScript execution. Having gained invaluable experience working with jQuery, I would continue using vanilla
        JavaScript for simple front-end tasks, but resort to jQuery for more complex tasks in order to increase my
        productivity, avoid rewriting existing code, and make use of abstracted, higher-level functions. Given that
        there are many recurring user-interface widgets in modern websites, I would also make use of jQuery's UI
        components. In the future, I would make extensive use of jQuery if page load times were important, since jQuery
        provides the functionality of loading critical information first and loading division elements on an as-needed
        basis.
    </p>

    <h2 id="success">Successful Aspects</h2>

    <h3>Use of whitespace to create harmony between sections and deliver a clear message</h3>

    <p>The use of white space is particularly important in a website that contains both newspaper layouts, which tend to
        be cluttered, and contact pages, which tend to be cleaner and visually driven. Striking a balance between white
        space and the preservation of an appropriate design was used to present a navigable and user-friendly interface.
        The whitespace considerations used in the ‘Contact Us’ and ‘About Us’ pages provided structural harmony to the
        site by offsetting the more crowded arrangement in the ‘Home’ and ‘Current News’ pages in an effort to send a
        coherent, comprehensible message. The whitespace was not only used as a separator to delineate different content
        sections, but
        also acted as a medium to draw focus to CTA buttons (i.e. increasing whitespace around the CTA as opposed to
        increasing the
        padding of the CTA) by creating flow between the elements.</p>

    <h3>Positioning critical content above the fold to attract user attention on page load</h3>

    <p>On each page, the section that captures the essence of the entire page is positioned as the first visible
        element. When a user first loads a page, their engagement with the site is determined by their initial
        impression.<br><br>
        Every page has a unique identifying ‘above the fold’ layout, each with their own compelling H1 header and visual
        media. It was crucial to be selective with the content above the fold, so as not to clutter the viewport and
        thus reduce the bounce rate. The typography is limited to two fonts and the main CTA buttons are subtle –
        stylistic choices that prioritized simplicity, in order to create cognitive fluency that would ultimately enable
        the user to process a few options at a time without being subject to an overload of information. Content
        placement can be further optimised by checking the website analytics to determine the most common screen size
        that visitors are using and thus more locate the fold with a higher degree of precision.
    </p>

    <h2 id="improvement">Areas of Improvement</h2>

    <h3>Incorporate device-independent event handlers to accommodate assistive technologies</h3>
    <p>With respect to areas of improvement, the incorporation of ‘onfocus’ and ‘onblur’ event handlers for the contact
        form and CTA buttons would make them device-independent. ‘Onfocus’ may be triggered by a keyboard, a mouse
        touch, or other assistive technology, which would render the site accessible for non-pointer devices, such as
        screen readers being used by vision-impaired users.
        It is essential to validate keyboard accessibility and ensure that the focus order of the page elements
        coincides with the visual order of the page, so that the focus is never trapped in any one element and cannot be
        escaped by the keyboard alone. In addition, users should have the option of skipping repetitive blocks of
        content, such as navigation links and header content, through a skip functionality. It is critical to ensure
        that accessibility problems do not arise as a byproduct of the event handlers, which may occur when the default
        behavior of the web browser is modified or the keyboard navigation is obstructed.
    </p>

    <h3>Striking a balance between a layout that reflects the semantics of each page name and a site-wide uniformity in
        page structure</h3>

    <p>Another obstacle I encountered throughout this project was striking a balance between page layouts that reflected
        the semantics of the page name and the overall uniformity of structure from page to page. This challenge
        occasionally compromised the consistent positioning of headers, which led to some discrepancies in font size and
        decorative elements – notably above the fold.<br><br>
        Moreover, the colour scheme of the website was not always cohesive as it did not complement the colours of the
        embedded images. A potential solution could be to use a colour palette that clashes less with the images, or to
        construct a custom colour palette based on the average pixel colour of the embedded images.
        An incohesive colour scheme could pose problems in an auto-updated site or one that uses a single template and
        has its content frequently updated by new items from a database. In order to combat this issue, a function could
        be written to generate and compute the ideal colour scheme for the current set of images. However, this solution
        could potentially diminish the user experience if a user is already accustomed to a previous colour scheme.

        • W3schools for HTML, CSS, and Javascript reference<br>
        • Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility requirements are considered<br>
        • Using popular websites such as Youtube and Facebook to reference responsive layout changes in relation to
        media
        queries<br>
        • Inspired by Wikipedia’s dark mode settings to create a contrast toggle feature<br>
        • Inspired by websites such as Visage.io that implemented sticky navigation bars. This
        website
        inspired me to create a compact version of my initial implementation - for simplicity and for an increased
        viewport area.<br>
        • Figma was used in the design and execution of the wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices<br>
        • The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to ensure that the HTML and CSS files conformed to HTML5 and CSS3
        specifications<br>
        • Visual Studio Code was used as the code editor, which provided a user-friendly interface to write the
        HTML/CSS/JS source code<br>
        • Google Drawings was used to develop preliminary blueprints of the web page layouts<br>
        • The media and textual content was acquired through the Google search engine using the Google Chrome
        browser<br>
        • Google Calendar was used to streamline the workflow: research, design, and execution phases were given strict
        deadlines, and accountability was enforced by a reminder system<br>
        • The Wacom Intuos Graphics Drawing Tablet was used in combination with Google Drawings to visualize the
        skeletons of the web pages<br>
