            <h2>Tera Raid Tips and Battle Mechanics | Pokemon Scarlet and Violet (SV)</h2>
            <p>The Tera Raid Battles are one of the features introduced by Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
                In these encounters, players get the opportunity to catch stronger Pokemon and some that are not available outside of the raid. 
                Preparing a team for the Tera Raid Battles requires planning and strategy.

                    <h3>What are the Tera Raid Battles?</h3>
                    <p>A Tera Raid Battle is a battle where four trainers take on a wild Terastalized Pokemon.
                        All trainers attack at the same time.</p><br />
                    <p>The Tera Raid Battles are divided into seven levels. Players start with access to one-star Tera Raid Battles. 
                        As they progress through the game and earn Gym Badges, the next levels start unlocking. 
                    </p><br />
                    <p>The higher the level, the stronger the wild Pokemon. Five-star raids will show up for those who finished the game with all three paths required. 
                        For the sixth level, players must complete the postgame events and some level five raids.</p>

                    <p>Players are limited to one Pokémon per Tera Raid battle, and it is by default the lead Pokémon in their party. 
                    Especially for higher Raids, players are incentivized to min-max several party members so that when they get to a Raid, they can choose a Pokémon that best fits the boss.
                    But that is overwhelming for newer players. Our aim here is to make things simpler for you so you can enjoy what Paldea has to offer stress free.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        When doing online Tera Raid Battles, try to choose a Pokemon that would synergize with the rest of the team. 
                        For example: if the other trainers in your team decide to bring Attacker Pokemon, try to choose a Support Pokemon that can provide healing, boost ally stats, or weaken the enemy, then vice versa if you think your team needs more firepower.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        If you play exclusively offline, we have a list of Pokemon you may start your solo raiding career with.

                    <p>
                        Take note that, defensively, the Tera Pokemon will follow its Tera Type instead of its own type, but its moves will remain the same.

                        This means that if you're up against an Dark Tera Type Tropius, your team should have strong Fairy Moves and can resist Flying and Grass Moves like Tinkaton.

                    <p>
                        Before you throw in yourself in a high level Raid, make sure your Pokemon is fully prepared! Farm EXP to level them up as high as you can, make them hold the right Held Item, equip them with the best moveset, and take them to Hyper Training! 
                        This will increase your chances of successfully completing high Tera Raid Star Levels online, or even solo them!

                    <p>Though the Tera Raid is a 'turnless battle', there are still technically 'turns' when you and the Tera Pokemon use moves against one another.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        Just like in normal Pokemon battles, who gets to use their move first is determined by two things: the move's Priority, and the Pokemon's Speed stat.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        If a Pokemon has high Speed and its move has higher priority, then it will most likely be the first to make its move in the raid's move order. Slow Pokemon with low priority moves will most likely use their moves last.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        To terastallize your Pokemon, it will have to attack the raid boss three times. This means your Pokemon must also survive the raid boss' counterattacks long enough for your Tera Orb to charge, so heal your Pokemon accordingly.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        If your Pokemon gets knocked out during Tera Raid Battles, it can be revived after a few seconds! They will also be revived back into full health, so you do not need to worry about sending back a weakened partner. Note that any pokemon that faints will reduce the remaining time left to defeat the Terestallized Pokemon, so make sure to keep your eyes on your Pokemon's HP.
                    </p><br />

                    <p>
                        During a battle, the Tera Raid Pokemon you battle against will do several things to disrupt the flow of the battle when its HP reaches approximately 50% or the timer reaches halfway. It will remove negative status effects from itself, nullify buffs and abilities of your Pokemon, also use a Tera Shield.
                    </p><br />
                    <!-- Image has zoom effect and alt text for accessibility -->
                    <img src="images/tera-break-shield.jpeg" alt="tera shield broken">
                    <p>
                        A Tera Shield protects the Tera Pokemon from status moves and also absorbs a lot of damage from Pokemon that haven't terastallized yet.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        This means if you want to break a Tera Shield as soon as possible, terastallize your Pokemon and use same type moves. It would be better if the moves are of a type the Tera Pokemon is weak against.
                    </p><br />
                    <img src="images/cheers.webp" alt="cheers">
                    <p>Each trainer can only use 3 Cheers per Raid, so you should make each of them count. Know when to use your Cheers and try to make your entire team benefit from them instead of just focusing on your own Pokemon.</p><br />
                    <p>We recommend saving all your Cheers for Heal up!, especially if your team can deal decent damage to the Tera Pokemon while also able to withstand several attacks from it.</p><br />
                    <p>The best time to use Go all out! is when the Attackers on your team have already Terestallized, which is available after attacking the Tera Pokemon thrice. This is to boost the damage of same type moves further and to make sure the stat boost won't go to waste if your Pokemon faint after using the Cheer early.</p><br />
                    <p>You can also use this or Hang tough! as soon as the battle starts if your team have their own healing Moves. Otherwise, save the available Cheers for Heal up!.</p><br />

                    <p>Each of these pokemon have a move that has 100 accuracy and guarantees additional damage the next time you use it in some way. In the case of Torch Song, it raises Skeledirge's special attack while Lumina Crash and Grav Apple guarantee the opposing pokemon becomes more susceptible to the move.

                    <p>Since you're not wasting time with set up moves, your Terastilization will be available very quickly.</p><br />
                    <p>Max out your Pokemon's HP stat, slap a Shell Bell on it and go to town. It will keep you healthy since the harder you hit, the more HP you get back. With this, you can drain tank your way through most raids even if they are hitting you with super effective damage.</p><br />
                    <p>Since you're not wasting time with set up moves, your Terastilization will be available very quickly.</p><br />
                    <p>With these setups, you can comfortably solo the following raids:</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; Any 3 and 4 Star Raids</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; 5 Star raids that you are super effective against or neutral against</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; 6 Star raids that you are super effective against</p><br />
                    <p>It goes without saying that there will be some raids that are just too frustrating (Yawn, Clear Smog, etc) but for the most part these Pokemon could clear out most of the raids. If you're just looking to farm candies and ability patches, you can forward your Switch's calendar by 1 day and just wait for a 6-star raid you're super effective against:</p><br />
                    <p>&#x2022; Grass, Bug, Ice, Steel (Skeledirge)</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; Fighting, Poison (Espathra)</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; Ground, Rock, Water (Flapple)</p><br />
                    <p>That's basically half of the exisiting types.</p><br />
                    <p>Enter the raid and just press the A button until you can Tera. Press R and then back to pressing A until you've won. It's seriously that easy.</p><br />
                    <p>It also goes without saying that these three won't cover every possible raid, however they will help you farm the candies and ability patches you need to build more Pokemon, as well as a lot of sellable items so you can make money and buy vitamins, mints, bottle caps, etc.</p><br />
