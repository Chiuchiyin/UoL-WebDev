                <p>Chess News was not once a popular and internationally renowned brand. The company has its roots as a
                    small startup that originated at Stanford University. The president of the Stanford chess club and
                    an avid chess player came together to create what is now known as Chess News. It was the passion,
                    curiosity, and desire to unite chess players across the world and provide a safe and pleasant
                    environment to access up to date and accurate news.</p>

                    eager chess fans, we require a team of over 300+ employees from over 40 countries. Many are employed
                    as remote developers and content editors. The decision to drop out of Stanford to pursue this avenue
                    was a tough one. However, it was one of the best choices that could have been made. As a company, we
                    promote kindness, generosity, and a joy of learning. We hope that our community can recognize and
                    uphold these standards.</p>

                    but emphasizes that young players tend to improve faster -->
                <p>At Chess News, we firmly believe that it is never too late to pick up chess as a hobby. If you study
                    chess books regularly and frequently play in longer time control games, it is feasible to become an
                    expert level player within a few years. Despite this, it is true that chess is a sport that is by
                    and large dominated by young players. If you wish to play chess at a professional level (i.e. making
                    a living out of chess), it is recommended that you start at a much younger age, since your ability
                    to learn new skills and process positional themes and patterns tends to be much sharper at a younger
                    age.</p>

                <h2>Short answer: there is no 'best opening'!</h2>
                <!-- This accordion window discusses the many factors that determine what opening is most suitable for
                a specific player, and how there does not exist a universally regarded 'best opening' -->
                <p>And now, for the more lengthy answer... There are many popular openings to choose from, which ranges
                    from the Italian game to the English opening, and the Queen's pawn. Choosing an opening depends on
                    several factors such as your experience level, the level of aggressiveness of your play, how
                    tactically or positionally sound your playstyle is, and how willing you are to learn many
                    intricate variations. With many factors to take into consideration, there is no definitive way of
                    declaring a 'best' opening.</p>

                <!-- This accordion window -->
                <p>It is much more efficient for a beginner or intermediate level player to hone in on a few common
                    openings such as the Sicilian Defense, the French Defense, and the Caro-Kann defence. This allows
                    you to understand the general plans for white and black, enables you to be in control of the game
                    (i.e. by playing in a theoretically optimal way), and presents you with a clear course of action
                    that
                    gives you a 'home field advantage' by being prepared for different possible lines. This approach is
                    not
                    limited to memorizing opening theory, but also serves to reinforces fundamental principles that
                    constitute
                    good chess.</p>
